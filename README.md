# HR Analytics Dashboard
## Project Objective
Developed an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize employee data, focusing on attrition trends and workforce distribution. The dashboard provided key HR insights like average salary, age distribution, attrition rates, and employee count by department, role, and education level. This project helped HR stakeholders make data-driven decisions for improving employee retention and organizational planning.

## Questions (KPIs)
•	What is the overall attrition rate in the organization?</br>
•	Which age group has the highest attrition?</br>
•	Which job role has the most employee attrition?</br>
•	How does education background impact attrition?</br>
•	Which salary slab sees the highest number of resignations?</br>
•	Are males or females leaving the company more often?</br>
•	How does attrition vary with years of service in the company?</br>
•	What is the average age and tenure of employees?</br>
•	Which department has the highest attrition rate?</br>
•	How does the attrition trend compare across different salary brackets?

# Key insights include:
•	Age groups and job roles most impacted by attrition
•	Correlation between education level and employee retention
•	Salary slabs with the highest resignation rates
•	Gender-wise attrition comparison

# Project measures Visual Insights:
•	Attrition by Age: Most attrition is in the 26–35 age group, which suggests mid-career employees are more likely to leave.</br>
•	Attrition by Salary: Employees with a salary below 5K have the highest attrition. This may indicate dissatisfaction with compensation.</br>
•	Attrition by Education: Medical and Life Sciences backgrounds show higher attrition, possibly due to better opportunities elsewhere.</br>
•	Attrition by Gender: More male employees have left the company compared to female employees.</br>
•	Attrition by Job Role: Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives are the most affected roles. This insight can help HR focus on retention strategies for these positions.</br>
•	Attrition by Years at Company: The highest attrition is seen in employees with 2-3 years of experience, possibly due to lack of career growth.</br>
